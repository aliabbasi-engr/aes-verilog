## AES Encryption - Verilog
The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), also known as Rijndael, is one of the most 
widely used encryption algorithms in Computer Networks ([Read more on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard)). 
This Verilog code implements the 128-AES encryption unit.

## How to Use
Create a new project in your desired synthesis or simulation tool, and add all 
".v" files to your project. Remember to choose "AES_128.v" as the top-level module.
The project is tested on Altera Quartus Prime Lite Edition v16.1.
